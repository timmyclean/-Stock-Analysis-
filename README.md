# -Stock-Analysis-
Analyzing Green Energy
### Overview of Project
After completing VBA code to analyze stock for Steve and his parents focusing on "Green Stocks". We were asked to refactor the code to see if could be made faster and to look over larger data sets. We did find alternatives for Steve and his parents in terms of stocks with better returns.

### Results
We found once refactoring the code we did see improvements in terms of the time it took to analyze. Please refer to attachments to see improvements.

Being new to VBA, my analysis of why its faster is not complete. The code before it was refactored was around 1 second, after refactoring its well below 1 second as per ".png's" above.

There are fewer steps in the refactored code. Which is why i would assume its faster. Also inconclusive if it would work for mare than 12 stocks.

### Summary

## Advantages and Disadvantages of Refactoring Code in VBA
"The cost of refactoring is higher than rewriting the code from scratch. Don't refactor the code if you don't have the time to test the refactored code before release. It can introduce bugs."(article Jan 9, 2017,https://www.c-sharpcorner.com/article/pros-and-cons-of-code-refactoring/)

- Saving time is advantage as well.

Finally Steve should suggest to his Parents that "DQ" is maybe not the best option for a stock Purchase.

Developing Skills is still necessary.
